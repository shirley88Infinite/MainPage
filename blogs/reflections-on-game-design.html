                <p>This book really left a strong impression on me. The Art of Game Design is not just another "how to make games" manual ‚Äî it's more like having a long conversation with a mentor who keeps asking you the real question: "What makes a game truly fun?"</p>

                <p>What I enjoyed most is how Jesse Schell doesn't just give surface-level advice. He starts from first principles, digging into the core: what is a game, why people play, and how fun itself works. It made me realize that game design isn't only about writing code or creating art, but about shaping meaningful human experiences.</p>

                <h2>üß© Breaking down the parts of a game</h2>

                <p>One of the most useful parts for me was how the book breaks games into Mechanics, Story, Aesthetics, and Technology:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mechanics:</strong> the rules, systems, the actions players can take.</li>
                    <li><strong>Story:</strong> the narrative, background, the reasons to care.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> not only visuals, but also sound, mood, and overall atmosphere.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technology:</strong> the tools and hardware that make it all possible.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Seeing it this way, I started to think of a game like a piece of music: mechanics set the rhythm, story provides the lyrics, aesthetics create the melody, and technology is the studio that makes it real. If one part is off, the whole experience feels unbalanced.</p>

                <h2>üß† üé¨ üé® üõ†Ô∏è Wearing different hats</h2>

                <p>The book also reminded me that a great game designer has to wear many hats:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>like a <strong>psychologist</strong>, to understand player motivation and emotions,</li>
                    <li>like a <strong>director</strong>, to craft pacing and tension,</li>
                    <li>like an <strong>artist</strong>, to shape the mood and style,</li>
                    <li>and like an <strong>engineer</strong>, to make sure everything runs smoothly.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Reading this, I realized: a game designer isn't just a "mechanics person" or a "coder." It's someone who can switch perspectives, and balance all of them.</p>

                <h2>üí° Why it matters today</h2>

                <p>In today's world, with AI tools getting more powerful, this feels even more relevant. AI can generate art, code snippets, even prototypes. But the real challenge is not in producing assets ‚Äî it's in designing experiences that feel meaningful and fun.</p>

                <p>That's why I feel this book is timeless. Technology will keep changing, but the ability to think like a designer ‚Äî balancing mechanics, story, aesthetics, and technology ‚Äî will always matter.</p>

                <h2>üìñ A line that stuck with me</h2>

                <p>Schell wrote: "The game is not the rules on the paper ‚Äî it is the experience that emerges when the player interacts with those rules."</p>

                <p>That line hit me. It's a reminder not to get lost in just the systems or the visuals, but to always return to the player's perspective: what are they feeling right now?</p>

                <h2>üéÆ Final thoughts</h2>

                <p>After reading The Art of Game Design, I feel more inspired not just to build systems, but to create experiences. Not just to fix bugs, but to ask: will players laugh, struggle, or feel wonder here?</p>

                <p>This book is more than a manual ‚Äî it's a lens. Once you put it on, your whole perspective on games changes. For me, it's something I know I'll come back to again and again.</p>
