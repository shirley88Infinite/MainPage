            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p class="small">During that time I was playing Hearthstone, I was inspired by its mix of deck-building strategy and fun RNG moments that kept every match fresh. I started wondering if I could create my own card game, and together with a designer friend we came up with a vampire theme infused with new elements.</p>

        <section class="section-block">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p class="small">This is a roguelike game with card battles as its core. Players need to play as a vampire ancestor to resist the attacks of a large number of adventurers and defeat three great heroes to achieve ultimate victory.</p>
            <p class="small"><strong>My Role:</strong> I worked with a teammate on the programming side, where my main responsibility was implementing the core combat system. In addition, I collaborated with the art team to experiment with AI-assisted asset design and generation, testing its potential for unique usability in the project.</p>
            
            <h3>Core Gameplay</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Defeat enemies using your skills and convert them into servants to fight alongside you.</li>
                <li>Servants can evolve into stronger units by defeating more enemies.</li>
                <li>Enemies drop items and souls, which can be used to boost combat or upgrade skills.</li>
                <li>Survive waves of heroes and adventurers—victory comes when all enemies are defeated.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Tech & Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented a simple turn-based system to manage player and enemy actions.</li>
                <li>Designed a basic card system with drag-and-drop interactions and collision-based effects.</li>
                <li>Built win/lose conditions and a minimal UI flow to support the core gameplay loop.</li>
                <li>Added a lightweight multi-language system, allowing the game to be easily localized into different languages.</li>
            </ul>
